/*
Task 4

Create some objects (at least 3) for different persons, specifying:

- `name`
- `age`
- `city`
- `profession`
*/


/*
Task 5

Add a method `introduce` to each object that returns a string
with the person introducing themselves

For example:

console.log(person1.introduce()); // My name is Steve, I am 
37 years old. I live in Tokyo where I work as a UX Designer
*/


/*
Task 6

Add a method `greet` to the objects from task 5.

The method should take another person object in input and it 
should return a message of one person greeting the other.

For example:

// assuming that person2 is Cindy
console.log(person1.greet(person2)); // Hello Cindy, how are you?
