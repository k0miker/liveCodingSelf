# Responsive Blog
[![Status overview badge](../../blob/badges/.github/badges/main/badge.svg)](#-results)


Lets create a responsive blog for coffee lovers! The following tasks will direct you towards building a blog page which has different views for both mobile and desktop.

## Tasks

Review the [style.css](/style.css) file. Use the provided [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) for colors and padding / margin while writing your CSS.

For these tasks you will have to update both the [index.html](/index.html) and [style.css](/style.css) files.

### Task 1

- Review the [mobile](./content/mobile-reference.png) reference image
- Build a page that matches it as closely as possible. You can find the [coffee image](/images/coffee-banner.jpg) in the [images](/images/) folder.

> Hint: Use `<section>` elements to separate
> Note: It is generally good practice to follow a 'mobile-first' design mindset

### Task 2

- Review the [desktop](./content/desktop-reference.png) reference image.
- Using **media queries**, set the breakpoint for the desktop view at `768px`, and create a new set of styles that recreates the layout in the reference image as closely as possible

### Task 3

The `<aside>` element should only appear only when the breakpoint is higher than `768px`

- Hide the `<aside>` element when the breakpoint is less than `768px` (mobile view)
